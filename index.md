A question I have recently answered with a playlist
I listen every time I work on something.
I don't know why this question is always at the forefront
of my mind, maybe its a vie for control in a world I feel
powerless over.
Either way, it doesn't effect me in the way you might think,
it empowers me, rather than pulling me down.
I'm pretty happy with the sound the end of the world makes.
