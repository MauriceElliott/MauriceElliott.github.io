This is a personal blog I've created to document the part of me I feel comfortable making public. Saying that, I am not opposed to the idea of feeling vulnerable. I am a sensitive person, and sometimes that's okay and acceptable if it provides others with the space to feel normal in their skin.

My name is Maurice, pronounced Morris. My mother is Syrian, my father is Irish. I am English born. Irish through citizenship. Syrian in temperament.

I am a father of two incredible children, Azriel my son is 4, Alaia my daughter is almost 2. I am also a husband to a wonderful wife.

I am a Software Engineer by trade, and a Software tinker by night....

I love programming. I'm not a huge fan of tech. tech minimalist is how I like to think of myself. 

The beauty of creating art, systems and tools through words alone have always inspired me. The beauty of great design and intelligent decisions are what draw me to this field, and what keep my passion for programming burning bright. But tech in the sense of the industry, and the gaping ravenous money making snake oil selling pit of dispair that comes with it is not to my taste. I wish we could be more responsible for our impact on the world. More caring of the needs of the many, rather than just the people on top. Less obsessed with the next big client, or next big advancement, and more invested in just making good, robust, interesting and extensible software.

Our profession is young though, and I've only been doing it 13 years now so I'm sure I'm not at the peak of my opinion on the matter. I'm sure with time, with guard rails, with a better understanding of how to manage the behemoth of code we continuously build upon, we will come to some sort out standardisation in the field. Maybe one day we will build programmes more responsibly. With more thought and care for those that come after us. With a better understanding of what it means to not only be a developer in the space, but someone that is responsible for the betterment of the art. Focusing on performance, and usability, rather than plethora of half baked features.

I am more positive than the above suggests, but my cinicism for Capitalism and the way it encorages us to live and to exploit others goes against everything I believe as a pacifist and a Christian. I greatly dislike this aspect of our industry and hope to some day either break free of it or help to rectify it in some small way.
