Golden does not seem like the right word for what I'm about to describe, but it is often ascribed to this style of image preparation.</p><p>Images for servers are generally implemented using a base server image, i.e. ubuntu server, or Windows server 2022, then a smorgasbord of seemingly random (but 100% essential) packages, binaries and server features are required before the server can be made available.</p><p>This process is costly, time consuming, and means everything required needs to be included in the bootstrapping script. You are probably used to doing something similar with docker. If anything is missed, the creation needs to begin anew. If something needs to be included in the server that wasn't originally included, a new server will need to be built.</p><p>I am here to tell you this doesn't need to be the case. We have transcended this costly process to provide something more useful. Less time consuming, and less prone to error. With the help of a tool designed for exactly this purpose.</p><h3>Packer</h3><p>I'm sure you've heard of <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>, but if not allow me to enlighten you. They are the company that makes Terraform, as well as Consul, and Vault. They also make the tool Packer, which is a configuration tool designed for defining and creating genericised VM images. Here's a code block from a configuration file I've been working on.</p><pre><code>  provisioner "shell" {
    script            = "./scripts/linux/software/restart.sh"
    valid_exit_codes  = [0]
    expect_disconnect = true
    max_retries       = 2
  }

  provisioner "shell" {
    script           = "./scripts/linux/software/download-ghrunner.sh"
    valid_exit_codes = [0]
    max_retries      = 3
    pause_before     = "30s"
  }
</code></pre><p>The first block restarts the machine, then the second waits 30 seconds for the machine to come back up, and downloads the Github action runners installation script. This is a typical set of steps within a packer image configuration. You can install any number of packages you need to be available within your environment just by including an install script, often using a package manager, within the configuration file.</p><p>Now that I've made the Github action runners install available within the image being prepared, when I go to set up a new runner I no longer have to wait for the download to complete before I can start the instantiation. We can do the same for many other tools, i.e. yq, jq, powershell, dotnet, sqlpackage, the azure or gcp cli, anything you can think of that would normally need to be installed when instantiating a new server can be put into the packer definition to reduce the spin up time of the VM instance, and give users a solid base to build their machine off of, without worrying about dependencies they might have missed and only including the ones that are critical to the work they are doing.</p><pre><code>  # What image is this image based off?
  image_publisher = "Canonical"
  image_offer     = "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
  image_sku       = "22_04-lts-gen2"
  os_type         = "Linux"
</code></pre><p>This code block is also from within the server definition, but from a different file. It defines the source for the base image of the server. This means that if you wish to change the image your server is based off, for instance if you upgrade, or wish to use a different Linux distribution it can easily be done. It also means the file that installs all of your required packages can be used independently of the backend server you are using, as long as the same package manager is available within it.</p><h3>Cascading updates</h3><p>I'm sure by now you can see the benefits of this set up. But another way of setting Packer definitions up can make this process even more powerful.</p><p>If you use a server image you've created as the basis for a new Packer definition, you can feed pre-defined images into other images, allowing you to build up the VM images on their way to specialisation.</p><p>I have not yet implemented this process in our new Github tenant, but in legacy Muddy Boots, we had a process that went something like this:</p><p>Windows Server &gt; Base Server	Takes Windows Server, and installs all of the necessary binaries, packages, tooling, and features required for every application server currently used by our applications.</p><p>Base Server &gt; Web Server	Enables IIS on the server, as well as other Windows Features for web servers, as well as some other tools for security and monitoring.</p><p>Web Server &gt; Product Specific Web Server	When further configuration was required, i.e. the product required a specific binary, or a specific license for something out of the ordinary or bespoke the product needed.</p><p>This set up meant if we needed to make an update to ever server currently deployed, we could update the base image, and if products needed something specific for new work they were doing, that was an easy update as well.</p><p>Another thing required by this set up is what are called Auto Scalers in GCP and Scale Sets in Azure. Basically a group of servers that can be scaled up or down depending on load. The other use is a very straightforward way to refresh an environment if a change needed to go out. You would simply Increase the number of available servers, and then delete the ones using old images, finally scaling down once the process was complete.</p><p>By leveraging this approach we remove the need for maintenance, give ourselves a simple and robust recovery method, and a way to nimbly update live application servers where required, without the need for down time.</p><p>Also in the scenario where an unnamed security provider decides to push an untested update that takes out the entire world's Windows Servers, our mode of recovery is simply to destroy and rebuild the affected servers, all within a short amount of time due to the readiness of our images.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Packer VM images can provide a much needed hardening of your servers configuration, a faster instantiation time for new servers, and along with auto scalers/scale sets they can also provide a quick recovery and maintenance method.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedawa.dev/posts/2024-10-16-your-pain-is-mine</guid><title>"Your pain is mine - Pain Synesthesia."</title><description></description><link>https://codedawa.dev/posts/2024-10-16-your-pain-is-mine</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 23:51:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday my son sustained a minor, but very painful injury to his hand and it made my entire body hurt. The feeling is referred to as pain synesthesia. It is an under researched area, so me saying this is most certainly self diagnosis, it was just the closest thing to what I felt that makes sense. I wanted to put my experience out there in case others find solace in the fact they are not alone.</p><p>For my entire life, I've had it to a lesser degree whenever my father would come home with scratches and cuts, sometimes bloodshot eyes, usually sustained from his work, but sometimes just from being careless outdoors. He worked with children and young adults with special needs for my entire life, and would sometimes take a beating from the people he worked with and supported, but sometimes he'd just be outdoors tracking through woods and sustain minor cuts from thorns or branches. Every time something like this happened and I witnessed the aftermath, I would get this feeling of discomfort and pain over my body. The pain he felt wouldn't be mine, but my body would react to the pain in a way that physically and mentally hurt me.</p><p>I remember another experience of this also, I was walking my dog on my lunch break, and a old lady stood with her dog chatting to someone over a garden fence was pulled off her feet by her dog, who lunged at my dog as I past. She must have had her keys in the hand she used to break her fall, because when she got up, her house key was jammed into her palm. The feeling was instant and breathtaking, I could not let go of it for weeks after. I still think about it sometimes and feel pain for that poor lady, and think about how much pain it must have caused her, and how long it would have taken her to heal.</p><p>Yesterday my son cut off part of his finger nail and a bit of finger with a toddler potato peeler, while helping his mother in the kitchen to peel foraged apples for apple crumble. The blood was intense, 20 mins of holding paper towels over the wound, and holding his arm above his head. Three large thick paper towels soaked in blood, a bloody plaster, and many splashes on floors and furniture. It's painful breaking a nail. Its painful bruising your nail, its even painful jamming something under your nail. But peeling a piece off with a peeler is something else. The pain he felt must have been excruciating. But my son is an absolute trooper. 3 years old, and only 30 minutes later he was telling us his finger was feeling better, and he wanted to take the plaster off.</p><p>Apologies for the thorough description, but I needed to paint a picture, just to confirm with you, the person reading this, that I am not alone in this feeling. During, I held myself together, to be strong for my son, so as not to panic him or his mother, but inside I was falling apart. The pain I felt up and down my skin, in my back, and in my stomach was intense. Not the same as sustaining an actual injury, but something closer to flu symptoms, sunburn and a stomach ache.</p><p>Once the clean up and first aid was over, and my son was sat on the sofa with his mother, being coddled and consoled, I went back to work. Somehow I managed to half focus on the work I had in front of me. But my emotions were high, I cried a bit, felt physically sick, felt weak, and for the entire rest of the evening I couldn't look at my son without feeling pain and strong emotion. He's so brave though, managed to make the most of his evening still and wanted to play even with his hand out of action.</p><p>But this wasn't all I felt. The feelings of failure, my failure to protect my son, my failure come to his aid quickly, my internal failure to keep myself from panicking while he was going through pain. The guilt of it not being me. In my head I know these feelings are unfounded, they have no baring on what actually happened or how I even handled it externally, but they are still very hard to reconcile. I'm struggling to forgive myself for something I know I need no forgivness for.</p><p>Later that evening I spoke to a close friend who is also a father. He consoled me, pointed out the flaws in my internal monologue, and helped to put things into perspective. I am blessed to have that support system as I know lots of fathers out there don't. It did not completely dispel the internal beating I was unleashing on myself, but at least slightly softened the blows.</p><p>In any case, pain synesthesia is uncommon. Some people can develop a heightened sense of empathy from the experience, while others find it so intense they become reclusive, and check out of daily life. Luckily I am not one of those, it only reaches its peak when the subject are those I feel a strong connection to, so for me, it is manageable. Supposedly it is also linked to phantom pain, the feeling amputee's experience in their missing limbs, which from my perspective would make sense, as it was a physical feeling as well as a mental one.</p><p>But enough about me, thank you for reading this far and if you feel the need, have experienced similar or just want to chat about programming and fatherhood you are welcome to join <a href="https://discord.gg/bd77a32zYn">my server on discord</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedawa.dev/posts/2024-10-07-welcome</guid><title>"Welcome!"</title><description></description><link>https://codedawa.dev/posts/2024-10-07-welcome</link><pubDate>Mon, 7 Oct 2024 22:08:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Hello, and welcome.</h3><p>This is a personal blog I've created to document the part of me I feel comfortable making public. Saying that, I am not opposed to the idea of feeling vulnerable. I am a sensitive person, and sometimes that's okay and acceptable if it provides others with the space to feel normal in their skin.</p><p>My name is Maurice, pronounced Morris, its a common Syrian name, due to the occupation of France in the middle east during the last century. My mother is Syrian, my father is Irish. I am English through birth. Irish through citizenship. Syrian in temperament. I am a father of two young children, Azriel my son is 3, Alaia my daughter is current 8 months. I am a husband to a wonderful wife. I am a Software Engineer by trade, and a tiny games developer by hobby.</p><p>I love programming. I'm not a huge fan of tech.</p><p>The beauty of creating art, systems and tools through words alone have always inspired me greatly. The beauty of great design and intelligent decisions are what draw me so heavily to this field, and what keep my passion for programming alive. But tech in the sense of the industry, and the gaping ravenous money making snake oil selling pit of dispair that comes with it is not to my taste. I wish we could be more responsible for our impact on the world. More caring of the needs of the many, rather than just the people on top. Less obsessed with the next big client, or next big advancement, and more invested in just making good, robust, interesting and extensible software.</p><p>Our profession is young though, and I've only been doing it 11 years now so I'm sure I'm not at the peak of my opinion on the matter. I'm sure with time, with guard rails, with a better understanding of how to manage the behemoth of code we continuously build upon, we will come to some sort out standardisation in the field. Maybe one day we will build programmes more responsibly. With more thought and care for those that come after us. With a better understanding of what it means to not only be a developer in the space, but someone that is responsible for the betterment of the art. Focusing on performance, and usability, rather than plethora of half baked features.</p><p>Anyways. Enough rambling about bad code. I'm making a game called "Life and Death at the End of the World". Its partly based on the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/">Project Zomboid</a>, and partly based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road">The Road by Cormac McCarthy</a>, which I read earlier this year and it hit me harder than any book I've read in recent memory. The feeling of despair, and tiny triumph in such an uncaring and careless world were so well conveyed, I had to try my hand at it.</p><p>I am also doing a lot of writing at the moment, due to picking up <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> as a note taking app and really enjoying the process of filling out a daily journal. So that plus having something worth talking about has brought me to starting this blog.</p><p>Feel welcome here and if you feel so inclined, join <a href="https://discord.gg/bd77a32zYn">my server on discord</a>, and come have a chat, about games, about programming, about fatherhood, or anything you feel comfortable with.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
